This document defines project governance for the project.

## Changes in Maintainership

Contributors who are interested in becoming a maintainer, if performing relevant responsibilities, should discuss their interest with the existing maintainers. New maintainers must be nominated by an existing maintainer and must be elected by 2/3 majority vote.

We do not expect anyone to make a permanent commitment to be a auth-gateway maintainer forever. After all, circumstances change, people get new jobs, new interests, and may not be able to continue contributing to the project. At the same time, we need to keep the list of maintainers current in order to have effective governance. People may be removed from the current list of maintainers via one of the following ways:


* They can resign
* If they stop contributing to the project for a period of 6 months or more
* By a 2/3 majority vote from active maintainers

Former maintainers are recognized with an honorary *Emeritus Maintainer* status, and have their names permanently listed in the [README](README.md) as a form of gratitude for their contributions.

## Approving PRs

PRs may be merged after receiving at least one positive votes (not sure about this sentence). If the PR author is a maintainer, this counts as a vote.

## Changes in Governance

All changes in Governance require a 2/3 majority vote.
