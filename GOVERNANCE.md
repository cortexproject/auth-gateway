# `auth-gateway` Governance

This document defines project governance for the project.

## Voting

In the event of an important decision that needs to be taken, both maintainers must come to a consensus for the decision to be approved.
If a consensus cannot be reached, the matter shall be put on hold until such a time where a consensus can be agreed upon.

## Changes in Maintainership

Contributors who are interested in becoming a maintainer, if performing relevant responsibilities, should discuss their interest with the existing maintainers.
New maintainers must be nominated by an existing maintainer and unanimously approved by the current maintainers.

We do not expect anyone to make a permanent commitment to be a `auth-gateway` maintainer forever.
Circumstances change, people get new jobs, new interests, and may not be able to continue contributing to the project.
However, to maintain effective governance, we need to keep the list of maintainers current.
People may be removed from the current list of maintainers via one of the following ways:

* They can resign
* If they stop contributing to the project for a period of 6 months or more
* By unanimous agreement of the other active maintainers

Former maintainers are recognized with an honorary *Emeritus Maintainer* status, and have their names permanently listed in the README as a form of gratitude for their contributions.

## Approving PRs

PRs may be merged after receiving approval from both maintainers.
If the PR author is a maintainer, the approval of the other maintainer is required.

## Changes in Governance

All changes in Governance require unanimous agreement of the maintainers.
